                    <li>I find it important to continuously refine my laptop's security posture for myself and by extent the security of the projects that I work on for my clients. Recently I've been keeping an eye out for a new laptop. Last time I did so, in 2021, I ended up with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_series#X200_and_X200s">Thinkpad X200</a>. The reason I did was that it was one of the few available <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/index.php/categories/laptops">RYF certified laptops</a> that <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> could run on, and those laptops don't have any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine">Intel Management Engine</a> (a security concern) on their chips. One reason to look at other options is that the laptop shuts down due to overheating or freezes sometimes when it's working hard. I could put in time to try to fix it, but it'll be hard to reach 100% confidence that it doesn't turn off in important video calls. Another reason is to get a higher end CPU, GPU and RAM capacity for local AI training that I may want to do. I still got my <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T440s">Thinkpad T440s</a> for when it's important the computer doesn't crash. It's however not ideal for AI workloads, contains working IME and its firmware is locked with Intel Boot Guard so I can't replace it with a free alternative. Long-story short, I narrowed my laptop search down to <a href="https://novacustom.com/cat/custom-laptop/">NovaCustom</a>. They have the option of disabling the IME and run <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a> which seems like it could be an acceptable compromise. I want to try running <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> as my main OS (I'm currently on <a href="https://www.parabola.nu/">Parabola</a>) and I saw a positive <a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2024-01-03-laptop-review-novacustom-nv41.html#_OpenBSD">review</a> on running OpenBSD on the NovaCustom NV41 laptop which bodes well. I'll mull this over some more before making a decision.</li>
