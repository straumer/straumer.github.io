                    <h1>Update #2</h1>
                    <code>Created: <time pubdate timedate="2024-10-14">2024-10-14</time></code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I went to a <a href="https://www.fjarskiptastofa.is/page/d50c3d79-28d3-4eee-8031-c92002c0db63">network security conference</a> of the <a href="https://www.fjarskiptastofa.is/english">Electronic Communications Office of Iceland</a>. I got some insight into what companies in Iceland are dealing with in that area nowadays as well as the new <a href="https://nis2directive.eu/what-is-nis2/">NIS2 EU directive</a> that they are expected to need to comply with. Disconnect between company leadership and their IT departments was a big topic and the need for deeper collaboration between them to improve the company's information security posture. I think IT people really benefit from knowledge of business administration in this regard. It lets them recognize the responsibilities and perspective of the leadership in order to effectively communicate security risks and lets the leadership take responsibility for them.</li>
                        <li>I've been working more on my <a href="https://github.com/straumer/makesite">makesite</a> static site generator alongside the updating of this site which is generated with it. Among the reasons of making it is that I thought it would be a nice project to cement my knowledge of make, m4 and the shell. Those are pretty commonly used in C/C++ build systems of projects I'd like to participate in.</li>
                        <li>I read chapters 6-10 of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book</a>. I like that the book explains Rust's safety features in the context of languages like C, so it also can teach us how to manually apply similar safety practices when coding in those languages.</li>
