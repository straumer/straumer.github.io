      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hope you all had a good week. One activity that I did was to publish my updates on pubstr, which includes a SOCKS5 proxy option and the generation of NIP-19 entities for events. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s the script I mentioned in my previous update: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/straumer/pubstr&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;https://github.com/straumer/pubstr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made nec, a small cli tool to convert between json and bech32 representations of NIP-19 Nostr entities. It&amp;rsquo;s a more complete alternative to the key-convertr tool that I was using before. I used nec in a script to create more useful Nostr links on my website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/straumer/nec&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;https://github.com/straumer/nec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago I had made my own rudimentary static site generator that generated my website with blogging functionality. Then I started learning more about Nostr and figured it would be more empowering to instead use Nostr as my single source of truth. I still needed a website, so I made some basic tooling and workflow to statically generate a website from my Nostr events. This time I opted to use Hugo for the site generation. Making my own generator was a nice learning experience though and definitely gives me more appreciation for the heavy lifting that Hugo can do for me now. I was also conscious that an easy and flexible way to generate a website from Nostr events is something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m making a reusable Hugo module along with the development of my site: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/straumer/hugo-nostr&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;https://github.com/straumer/hugo-nostr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
