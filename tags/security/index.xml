      <description>As a person who&amp;rsquo;s quite interested in information security, I like to play mental games that involve the imagination of threats and how one could establish and improve one&amp;rsquo;s defenses against them in case they materialize. One important case to consider is: What would happen if one loses all one&amp;rsquo;s possessions to the point of being practically naked in the street or wherever. In this case, all of our data outside of our minds, be they digital or written, would disappear. We want to make sure that the response to this question is that nothing would happen and that we would stoically continue on like a recently arrived Terminator. Normally it&amp;rsquo;s possible to leave data backups with third parties, but here I talk in the context of individuals that want maximum security, where they are the only ones that should have the power to access the contained data. This case requires the encryption of the data with a random password that is difficult to remember without memory techniques. To this purpose I dedicate this article where I explain my application of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://artofmemory.com/blog/pao-system/&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;PAO&lt;/a&gt; memory technique for readable &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; symbols.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a network security conference of the Electronic Communications Office of Iceland. I got some insight into what companies in Iceland are dealing with in that area nowadays as well as the new NIS2 EU directive that they are expected to need to comply with. Disconnect between company leadership and their IT departments was a big topic and the need for deeper collaboration between them to improve the company&amp;rsquo;s information security posture. I think IT people really benefit from knowledge of business administration in this regard. It lets them recognize the responsibilities and perspective of the leadership in order to effectively communicate security risks and lets the leadership take responsibility for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
